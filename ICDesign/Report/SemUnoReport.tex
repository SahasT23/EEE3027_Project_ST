    \item Explain the operation of the inverter circuit.
    \item 1B, Annotate the file (All 7 lines)
    \item TASK 1C: DC Modes You have simulated the DC transfer characteristic of a CMOS inverter by sweeping the input voltage Vin from 0 V to 5 V. Plot the 
    output voltage Vout against Vin. On your plot of Vout vs. Vin, clearly mark and label the following five operating points:
    A: Vin=0, B: Vin=1, C: Vin=2.5, D: Vin=4, E: Vin=5, For each point (Aâ€“E), identify the operating region of both the NMOS and PMOS transistors: Cutoff
    Triode (Linear) or Saturation, showing it as a table, and approximate Vout at each point.
    \item TASK 1D, NMOS pull up example, show the sweep as well, then answer these 5 questions:
    \item Q1. (1 mark) What is the highest output voltage reached in the NMOS pull-up version? Why does it not reach 5 V?
    \item Q2. (1 mark) Explain what happens to the NMOS pull-up transistor when Vin=0. Is it conducting?
    \item Q3. (1 mark) Describe what would happen if this NMOS-only inverter drove another CMOS logic gate. What are the risks?
    \item Q4. (1 mark) Why does a PMOS transistor avoid this issue? How does it behave differently from NMOS in pull-up?
    \item Q5. (2 marks) On your NMOS-only inverter plot, annotate the output voltage limit and mark the region where a 1 cannot be produced.
    \item TASK 2: TASK 2: CMOS Inverter Design for Delay Specification
    Use LTspice and theoretical models to design an inverter that meets timing specifications. Analyze
    performance using simulation and transistor-level delay theory (including propagation delay, rise/fall
    time, capacitive loading).
    \item TASK 2 Question 1 Transient Simulation and Analysis.
    \item TASK 2 Question 2 RC Delay Model.
    \item TASK 2 Question 3 Design and New Alternatives for performance.
    \item TASK 2 Question 4 Selection of questions to be answered.
